FeedBack Incorporated:

- In response to feedback saying that our student dashboard should be more accessible, we removed our RAG indicator and placed all test result data in our reports page and does not use color as an indicator of correct/incorrect-ness.

- In response to feedback saying that our concept already requires a lot of work on the professor's end, we have reduced the question format options so that they are all multiple choice, while still leveraging our adaptive model.

- In response to feedback saying that providing a large enough dataset to support our adaptive model, we are planning to add the import file option offered to the professor to create a question bank so that our software will be easier for them to use.
